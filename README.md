I designed and deployed an interactive 3D boxes background with a user-interactive "Magic" button to enhance user engagement. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a cutting-edge backdrop featuring captivating visuals. To ensure seamless performance, I implemented performance optimization techniques for smooth transitions between different box layouts. Additionally, I developed a user-interactive "Magic" button with a smooth transition effect, enabling users to toggle between a standard and expanded 3D box layout. This enhancement significantly improved the overall user experience, providing an engaging and dynamic backdrop for various applications.
